Chapter 1: The Orphaned Girl

Mary Mennox sat alone in her room, surrounded by the stifling heat of the Indian summer. She was only ten years old, yet she had already seen more death than most adults. Her parents had succumbed to the cruel grip of cholera, leaving her an orphan in a land far from her homeland of England.

The servants bustled about the house, their faces drawn with grief and worry. Mary watched them from her window, feeling detached from the sorrow that enveloped them all. She had never been close to her parents, raised instead by a succession of Indian nurses and servants. Their deaths meant little to her beyond the inconvenience of having to find a new home.

A knock at the door interrupted her thoughts, and Mrs. Medlock, the housekeeper, entered without waiting for a response. She was a stern woman with a face like granite, her eyes assessing Mary with a mixture of disdain and duty.

"Your uncle has sent for you," Mrs. Medlock announced brusquely. "You are to come with me to England."

Mary felt a surge of resentment at being ordered about like a servant. She was unused to being told what to do, accustomed instead to having her every whim catered to by the household staff. But there was little choice in the matter; with her parents gone, she had no one else to turn to.

Without a word, Mary gathered her belongings and followed Mrs. Medlock out of the only home she had ever known. The journey to England was long and arduous, and Mary spent much of it lost in her own thoughts.

When they finally arrived at Misselthwaite Manor, Mary was struck by the imposing size of the estate. The manor loomed darkly against the grey sky, its windows shuttered and its gardens overgrown with weeds.

"This will be your new home," Mrs. Medlock informed her, her voice devoid of emotion. "You will live with your uncle, Archibald Craven, and obey his rules."

Mary said nothing, too overwhelmed by the enormity of her new surroundings to form coherent thoughts. She followed Mrs. Medlock into the house, her footsteps echoing in the empty halls.

As they climbed the grand staircase, Mary couldn't help but feel a sense of unease settling over her. Misselthwaite Manor was a far cry from the opulent homes she had known in India, its faded grandeur a testament to years of neglect and decay.

But amidst the gloom, Mary sensed the promise of something new and unexpected. She had always been a curious child, drawn to mystery and adventure. And as she stepped into her new life at Misselthwaite Manor, she knew that her greatest adventure was yet to comes.
