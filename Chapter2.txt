Chapter 2: Exploring the Manor

Mary's days at Misselthwaite Manor fell into a monotonous routine. Each morning, she would rise early and wander the halls of the vast estate, her footsteps echoing in the empty corridors. Mrs. Medlock kept a close eye on her, wary of her curious nature and rebellious spirit.

One day, as Mary roamed the grounds of the manor, she stumbled upon a hidden path leading into the depths of the estate. Intrigued, she followed it eagerly, her heart pounding with excitement. The path wound its way through thick undergrowth and tangled vines, leading her deeper into the heart of the estate.

Eventually, Mary emerged into a secluded corner of the garden, hidden from view by towering hedges and ancient trees. In the center of the garden stood a locked gate, its rusted bars a stark contrast to the lush greenery that surrounded it.

Determined to uncover the garden's secrets, Mary set about searching for the key. She scoured every inch of the manor, turning over furniture and rifling through drawers in her quest to find it. But the key remained elusive, its whereabouts shrouded in mystery.

Undeterred, Mary enlisted the help of Martha, the friendly maid who had befriended her on her arrival at the manor. Together, they combed through the attic and the basement, searching for any clue that might lead them to the key.

Finally, after days of searching, their efforts were rewarded. Martha discovered an old set of keys hidden away in a forgotten corner of the attic, and among them was a small brass key that matched the lock on the garden gate.

With trembling hands, Mary took the key and set off for the garden, her heart pounding with excitement. As she approached the gate, she felt a surge of anticipation, knowing that she was about to uncover the garden's long-hidden secrets.

With a flick of her wrist, Mary inserted the key into the lock and turned it slowly. The gate creaked open, revealing a world of wonder beyond. Mary stepped through the gate and into the garden, her eyes widening with awe at the sight that greeted her.
